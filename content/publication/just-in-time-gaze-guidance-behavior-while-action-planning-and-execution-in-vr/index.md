abstract: Eye movements in the natural environment have primarily been studied
  for over-learned everyday activities such as tea-making, sandwich making,
  driving that have a fixed sequence of actions associated with them. These
  studies indicate a just-in-time strategy of fixations i.e. the fixation
  provides the information for a particular action immediately precedes that
  action. However, it is unclear if this strategy is also in play when the task
  is novel and a sequence of actions must be planned in the moment. To study
  attention mechanisms in a novel task in a natural environment, we recorded
  gaze and body movement data in a virtual environment while subjects performed
  a sorting task where they sorted objects based on object features on a
  life-size shelf. To study the action planning and execution related gaze
  guidance behavior we also controlled the complexity of the sorting task by
  introducing EASY and HARD tasks. We show that subjects are close to optimal
  while performing EASY trials and are more sub-optimal while performing HARD
  tasks. Based on the scan-paths as well as latency of first fixations on the
  task-related ROIs during action planning and execution we show that subjects
  use a just-in-time strategy of fixating on the task relevant objects. From our
  findings, we can conclude that subjects use the just-in-time strategy in a way
  that sacrifices optimality by offloading cognitive task demands on the
  environment. These findings also lend further support to the embodied
  cognitive framework of cognitive processing in natural environments.
