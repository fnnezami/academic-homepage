I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabrück.  I am the  Virtual Reality laboratory manager and have research mainly on Human-Machine Interaction in the context of trust in the usability of state-of-the-art self-driving cars. 

I have mainly focused on human trust in AI using technology acceptance questionnaires and behavioral data such as eye-tracking.
