abstract: Virtual environments will deeply alter the way we conduct scientific
  studies on human behavior. Possible applications range from spatial navigation
  over addressing moral dilemmas in a more natural manner to therapeutic
  applications for affective disorders. The decisive factor for this broad range
  of applications is that virtual reality (VR) is able to combine a
  well-controlled experimental environment together with the ecological validity
  of the immersion of test subjects. Until now, however, programming such an
  environment in Unity® requires profound knowledge of C# programming, 3D design
  and computer graphics. In order to give interested research groups access to a
  realistic VR environment which can easily adapt to the varying needs of
  experiments, we developed a large, open source, scriptable and modular VR
  city. It covers an area of 230 hectare, up to 150 self-driving vehicles and
  655 active and passive pedestrians and thousands of nature assets to make it
  both highly dynamic and realistic. Furthermore, the repository presented here
  contains a stand-alone City AI toolkit for creating avatars and customizing
  cars. Finally, the package contains code to easily set up VR studies. All main
  functions are integrated into the graphical user interface of the Unity®
  Editor to ease the use of the embedded functionalities. In summary, the
  project named Westdrive is developed to enable research groups to access a
  state-of-the-art VR environment that is easily adapted to specific needs and
  allows focus on the respective research question.
