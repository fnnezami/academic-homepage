abstract: With the introduction of autonomous vehicles, drivers will be able to
  engage in non-related tasks while being driven. But in critical situations,
  the car needs the support of the human driver. How do distracted drivers get
  back into the control-loop quickly when the car requests a take-over? To
  investigate effective take-over actions, we developed an interactive virtual
  reality experiment, that uses the premises of the embodied cognition theory.
  Accordingly, the car should not only provide sensory input but also help
  enhance the driver’s motor response by interpreting intention and thus helping
  to accomplish desired actions. This binds humans and machines together in
  becoming true cooperation partners in joint action. Therefore, we aim for
  close monitoring of participants combined with sensorimotor feedforward and
  feedback. The presented prototype also serves as an open-access,
  cost-efficient toolkit that enables interested researchers to tailor the
  presented LoopAR tool to their own needs as part of a previously published
  toolkit called WestDrive. With the presented work, we hope to shift the
  paradigm of future research from only visual aids to full sensorimotor
  integration assistance.
