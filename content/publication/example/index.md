abstract: Self-driving cars have the potential to greatly improve public safety.
  However, their introduction onto public roads must overcome both ethical and
  technical challenges. To further understand the ethical issues of introducing
  self-driving cars, we conducted two moral judgement studies investigating
  potential differences in the moral norms applied to human drivers and
  self-driving cars. In the experiments, participants made judgements on a
  series of dilemma situations involving human drivers or self-driving cars. We
  manipulated which perspective situations were presented from in order to
  ascertain the effect of perspective on moral judgements. Two main findings
  were apparent from the results of the experiments. First, human drivers and
  self-driving cars were largely judged similarly. However, there was a stronger
  tendency to prefer self-driving cars to act in ways to minimise harm, compared
  to human drivers. Second, there was an indication that perspective influences
  judgements in some situations. Specifically, when considering situations from
  the perspective of a pedestrian, people preferred actions that would endanger
  car occupants instead of themselves. However, they did not show such a
  self-preservation tendency when the alternative was to endanger other
  pedestrians to save themselves. This effect was more prevalent for judgements
  on human drivers than self-driving cars. Overall, the results extend and agree
  with previous research, again contradicting existing ethical guidelines for
  self-driving car decision making and highlighting the difficulties with
  adapting public opinion to decision making algorithms.
