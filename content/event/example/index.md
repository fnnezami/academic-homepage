  Fully autonomous vehicles as cognitive agents will be one of the decisive use
  cases of artificial intelligence in the middle of modern societies. However,
  the potential positive effects of this technology will only apply if
  autonomous cars are accepted by a majority of the society the cars will
  operate in. To increase acceptance and trust, we created a virtual
  self-explaining car informing passengers prior to actions.  In this study, we
  investigate the current attitude of the German and Austrian population (N =
  8599) in a virtual reality experience. Participants experienced a ninety
  seconds virtual drive in one of three conditions of auditive feedforward and
  feedback, while head tracking data, and a simplified gaze vector were
  recorded. Our main finding is that a self-explaining car does have a positive
  impact on trust, but not influence the intention of using such a car.
  Additionally, we can show gender and age effects with female participants
  being generally less trusting in all conditions compared to male participants
  and a general decrease of acceptance with increasing age. Results are in line
  with previous human-machine research, supporting found gender differences as
  well as the fact that communications increase driving safety, but also
  negative emotional responses. These findings reveal a need for a well balanced
  self-explanatory artificial intelligence to enable human-machine interactions
  that foster safe traffic behavior and increase trust as well as the
  willingness to use such technology
